yq
==

Pure Python implementation of a subset of the features of
|jq|_ for ``YAML`` documents.

**Status**: No active development planned, maintenance work only. This repository
is superseded by https://github.com/kislyuk/yq in PyPI, starting with version ``2.0.0``.

If you're looking for a way to do ``jq``-like filtering on ``YAML`` documents,
you'll probably be better off using the ``yq`` provided by |y2j|_ or |kislyuk|_. They
provides a wrapper around ``jq`` that transforms the input ``YAML`` into
``JSON``, calls out to ``jq``, then transforms the result back. This means it
automatically supports the full feature set of ``jq``.

If for some reason you need a pure python implementation, this repo is
for you.

Setup
-----

::

    pip install 'yq < 2.0.0'

What's implemented?
-------------------

Everything from the `Basic
Filters <http://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Basicfilters>`__ section
of the ``jq`` manual is supported - at least ``yq`` acts the same way as
``jq`` in the examples there. Object construction also more or less
works.

Known limitations
-----------------

The parsing technology used in this project (parser combinators) is
not powerful enough to support parsing some of the more complex features of
``jq``.

Hacking
-------

::

    virtualenv virtualenv
    . virtualenv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Optionally install as a package:
    pip install .

There are basic unit-tests for some of the operators, but the meat of
the test suite are the functional tests defined in
``functional_tests/*.yml`` files and run by ``run_functional_tests.py``.

The whole test suite of ``jq`` is in ``functional_tests/jq.txt``, run by
``run_jq_tests.py``. Sections starting with a line containing ``skip``
are, surprisingly, skipped - until that functionality is implemented.

They're all started by ``nosetests``

Roadmap
-------

Here are some steps that'd need to be taken to bring the feature set of
this ``yq`` closer to that of ``jq``.

-  Work the same way as ``jq`` for the "Types and Values" section
-  Operators, functions
-  Check if operators can be refactored
-  Package, release
-  Conditionals, comparisons
-  "Advanced features", Assignment from the ``jq`` manual
